How to upload in launchpad

    Run ssh-keygen -t rsa
    Open .ssh/id_rsa.pub using a text editor (gedit will do)
    Copy the entire contents of the file (one very long line).
    Open https://launchpad.net/~/+editsshkeys on your browser
    Under "Add an SSH key", paste the line from step 3, then click on "Import Key".
